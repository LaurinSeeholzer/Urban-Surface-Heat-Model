# Urban Surface Heat Model

The urban-surface-heat-model was developed by [Laurin Seeholzer](https://www.github.com/laurinseeholzer) as a final Project at the [Kantonsschule Reussb√ºhl](https://ksreussbuehl.lu.ch). The model is a simulation based aproach to analyzing the behaviour of surface temperatures in urban areas. 

Ontop of the Main-Script ```simulation.js``` a userinterface was developed using [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The userinterface is available at: [laurinseeholzer.github.io/Urban-Surface-Heat-Model](https://laurinseeholzer.github.io/Urban-Surface-Heat-Model)

The userinterface allows users to create, configure and run custom simultions (You can use the mapData.json and surfaceMaterials.json file in the simulationData folder for testing purposes). The Simulation results are then visualized by heatmaps.

**Note**: Documentations about the usage of the Webapplication will be released soon
