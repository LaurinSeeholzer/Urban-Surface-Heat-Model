# Urban Surface Heat Model

The urban-surface-heat-model was developed by [Laurin Seeholzer](https://www.github.com/laurinseeholzer) as a final Project at the [Kantonsschule Reussb√ºhl](https://ksreussbuehl.lu.ch). The model is a simulation based aproach to analyzing the behaviour of surface temperatures in urban areas. 

Ontop of the Main-Script ```simulation.js``` a userinterface was developed using [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The userinterface allows users to create, configure and run custom simultions. The Simulation results are then visualized by heatmaps.

**Note**: Documentations about the usage of the Webapplication will be released soon
